Hi Mia,

Just wanted to follow up in case my last note got buried.

I run a private lending fund in Del Mar. We do business-purpose loans for investors — bridge loans, flips, new builds, that kind of thing. We've done a ton of deals in SoCal so we can usually close in under 10 days.

No pressure — just wanted to make sure it landed in case it's ever useful.
