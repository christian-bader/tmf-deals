Hi Mia,

I noticed your listing at 383 Westbourne is currently pending — congratulations.

I’m reaching out because I work with many agents who like having a reliable backup lending option in place, just in case a buyer’s financing gets delayed or falls through.

I’m with Trinity Mortgage Fund, a Del Mar–based private lender. We provide fast hard money purchase, bridge, and construction loans for investment properties, and we’re often able to step in and help agents keep deals together when timing is critical.

Key highlights:

• $1M–$10M loan amounts
• Up to 75% of market value
• No appraisals, personal financials, or guarantees
• Close in as little as 5–10 days
• 12–24 month terms
• Interest-only payments

We’ve recently helped agents salvage and close transactions like:

• $3.6M construction loan on an oceanfront lot in Encinitas (60% LTV)
• $3.771M purchase loan on a 5,000 SF home in Pacific Highlands (75% LTV)
• $2.65M purchase loan on a vacant lot in La Jolla (65% LTV)

Hopefully your current escrow goes smoothly, but if you ever need a quick backup solution for this deal or a future one, I’d be happy to help.

Would it make sense to connect so you have a reliable option in your back pocket?

Best,
