Hi Mia,

Congrats on closing 383 Westbourne.

I run a private lending fund in Del Mar. We do business-purpose loans for investors — bridge loans, flips, new builds, that kind of thing. If your buyer picked it up as an investment and wants to renovate or do a tear-down rebuild, we can usually close in under 10 days.

Just wanted to put it on your radar. Either way, nice deal.
