Hi Mia,

Saw your listing at 383 Westbourne — beautiful spot.

I run a private lending fund in Del Mar. We do business-purpose loans for investors — bridge loans, flips, new builds, that kind of thing. We can usually close in under 10 days.

No need to respond — just wanted to introduce myself in case you ever have an investor client who needs to move fast.
