Hi Mia,

Congrats on 383 Westbourne going pending.

I run a private lending fund in Del Mar. We do business-purpose loans for investors — bridge loans, flips, new builds, that kind of thing. If financing ever gets shaky on an investment property, we can usually step in and close in under 10 days. We've done a lot of deals in SoCal so we move quick.

Hopefully everything goes smoothly. But if not, happy to help.
